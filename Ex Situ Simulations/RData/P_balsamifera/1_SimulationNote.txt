When running simulation for P. balsamifera, an error message pop up:
'lapply(x, as.integer): NAs introduced' (from memory, may not be exactly this).
This error come from the fact that when using df2genind function, the individual with
only one allele unknown (line 351, col SZ and TA) consider '-9' as an allele. After a 
control, genetic parameters estimated using basic.stats() do not change because of the
error. Therefore, the one-missing allele was kept for simulations 2 and 3
