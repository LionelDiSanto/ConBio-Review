For all simulations, the environmental, geographic and genetic datasets used were:
From native distribution filtered for population without environmental data
(_native_filtered)

Values of Npop=5,10 were not tested for both realistic and theoretical simulations because
at least one of the four methods (Random, GeoBased, EnvBased, GeoEnvBased) could  not be run.
